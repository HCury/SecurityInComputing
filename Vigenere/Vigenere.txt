1. Explanation
The Vigenere code works by taking the argv[1] (the text file)
and looping through until the end of file(EOF). Using tolower and
isalpha we can get rid of any characters that are uppercased or
is a special character respectively. Once that is done, we can proceed
and use arithmetic:

``
// testChar = temp;
// value = testChar - 97;
// key_int = IV[i % blockSize] - 97;
// testChar = (value + key_int) % 26 + 97;
// key_int = key[i % blockSize] - 97;
// value = testChar - 97;
// testChar = (value + key_int) % 26 + 97;
// IV[i % blockSize] = testChar;
// array[i] = testChar;
``

We then print out character by character. The problem with printing out character
by character is that I could not figure out how to decrypt character by character.
I tried to call the strcat function but had no success as I kept receiving a Seg
Fault.


2. Compiling and Executing
To run the code you must input a file as the command argument [1]. After that goes
the key in argument[2] followed by the initial vector in argument[3].
